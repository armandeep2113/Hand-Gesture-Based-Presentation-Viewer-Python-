# Hand-Gesture-Based-Presentation-Viewer-Python-
Developed a hands-free presentation system using cvzone, mediapipe, and opencv-python for real-time hand gesture recognition. Features include slide navigation, custom drawing with finger gestures, and a Tkinter-based GUI for dynamic updates. Designed independently, combining various Python libraries for an interactive user experience.
